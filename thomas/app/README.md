INFOS:

Microsoft Azure provides excellent object storage with  Azure Blob Storage, which offers unmatched durability, virtually infinite capacity and multiple tiers of storage, all at very convenient rates. However, because Azure Blob Storage was developed before the world decided to “standardize” on the S3 APIs, the two use different interfaces, and so most applications and libraries designed to work with Amazon S3 do not support Azure out-of-the-box.
